# GetAround deployment project - Delay analysis and car rental price prediction

This project has been presented as part of my **Machine Learning Engineer certificate** for the Jedha Data Fullstack program.

## Company

[GetAround](https://www.getaround.com/?wpsrc=Google+Organic+Search) is the Airbnb for cars. You can rent cars from any person for a few hours to a few days! Founded in 2009, this company has known rapid growth. In 2019, they count over 5 million users and about 20K available cars worldwide. 

## Project

Occasionally, individuals who have rented a car through GetAround arrive late for their checkouts. This lateness can potentially disrupt the subsequent rental of the same vehicle, leading to a negative influence on service quality and customer satisfaction.

## Goal

The objective of this specific initiative is to establish an online dashboard with the purpose of assisting GetAround in achieving the following:

* Assess the significance of the problem.
* Model the potential effects of introducing a minimum time interval between successive rentals of the same vehicle on the overall business dynamics.
